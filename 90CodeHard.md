This journey won't be easy, but it will be incredibly rewarding. In this blog, we'll outline the steps and skills you'll need to succeed in this coding hard challenge.

## Week 1-2: Learn to Do Things on Your Own (Independent Developer/Hustle)

The first two weeks are all about setting the right mindset. You need to embrace the hustle and develop the attitude of an independent developer. This means pushing through difficult problems, seeking solutions on your own, and not being afraid to ask for help when needed.

## Week 3-4: Master the Fundamentals

Before diving into more complex concepts, it's crucial to have a strong foundation. Focus on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript during these weeks. Explore official documentation and understand how these technologies work together to create web applications.

## Week 5-6: Complete Assignments and Practice Regularly

Assignments are the best way to reinforce your learning. Commit to doing 15 hours of practice per week on assignments related to the fundamentals you've learned. Regular practice is key to becoming a proficient developer.

## Week 7-8: Build Projects

Now that you have a solid grasp of the fundamentals, it's time to apply your knowledge. Dedicate 5 hours a week to building projects that incorporate the concepts you've learned. This will help you get comfortable with coding for extended periods.

## Week 9-10: Dive into Backend Development

Start exploring the backend realm. Learn Node.js, Express.js, OpenAPI (Swagger), TRPC, and GraphQL by delving into their official documentation. Backend development is a crucial part of fullstack development.

## Week 11-12: Database and Frontend Mastery

Continue your journey by mastering databases like Mongo, MySQL, Postgres, and ORM tools like Prisma. Concurrently, delve into frontend development using React.js and Next.js. Understanding both sides of web development is essential for fullstack expertise.

## Week 13-14: Deployment, Testing, and Caching

Learn how to deploy your applications on platforms like AWS (EC2) and use GitHub CI/CD and Vercel for continuous integration and deployment. Explore testing with Jest and Cypress and dive into caching using Redis.

## Week 15-16: Explore More Tools

The final weeks are dedicated to expanding your toolkit. Get familiar with TurboRepo, Docker, and other relevant technologies that will make you a versatile developer.

## Throughout the Journey: Network and Stay Focused

Networking is crucial in the tech industry. Message five people every day and send LinkedIn requests to professionals in the field. Building relationships can open up opportunities.

Remember, it's normal to encounter failures and setbacks. Don't let them discourage you. Keep pushing forward, and eventually, you'll overcome obstacles.

Lastly, don't leave projects incomplete. Finish what you start, even if it's challenging. Completing projects will give you a sense of accomplishment and help you learn and grow.

Let's go on the 90-day journey together to become an independent fullstack web developer and open-source contributor. It's a challenging but rewarding endeavor. By following this roadmap and focusing on official documentation, you'll acquire the skills and mindset needed to excel in the world of web development. Don't forget to share your progress with the community using hashtags like #sourceopen, #90codehard, and #documentationbasedlearning on Twitter and LinkedIn. Good luck on your coding hard challenge!
